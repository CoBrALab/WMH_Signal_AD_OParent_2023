# Description
 
This repository contains all analysis code and processed data to reproduce the main results for the preprint titled "Assessment of white matter hyperintensity severity using multimodal MRI in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease" available here https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.20.524929.

Results in raw form and figures are also available for every main analysis.

All processed data is available in the two CSVs df_pvdeepswm.csv (for the periventricular / deep / superficial white matter parcellation) and df_lobar.csv (for the lobar parcellation). Only this data is needed to run all analyses.

Analysis code is organized such that every analysis contains a .R or .py file with the same name as the folder, and should be run in order to reproduce the results. In every folder, raw results are in the subfolder 'results_paper', and figures are in the subfolder 'visualization_paper'. If the code is run, it will create two new folders: 'results' and 'visualization' with the reproduced results and figures.
